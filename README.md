<h1>Complex Network Project - eNSP Simulator</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates a complex network setup using the eNSP simulator. The network incorporates essential networking features, including static routing, dynamic routing, RSTP, STP, DHCP, Relay, FTP, DNS, and more. The setup is designed to simulate real-world networking scenarios and test various configurations and protocols.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Static Routing</li>
    <li>Dynamic Routing (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP)</li>
    <li>Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)</li>
    <li>Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)</li>
    <li>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</li>
    <li>DHCP Relay</li>
    <li>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</li>
    <li>Domain Name System (DNS)</li>
    <li>RIP</li>
  <li>ACL</li>
  <li>ETHERNET TRUNK</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with this project, you need to have the eNSP simulator installed on your system. You can download it from the official Huawei website.</p>

<pre><code>
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TAHA2255/COMPLEX-NETWORK-eNSP.git

# Open the project in eNSP
# Open the topo file
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This network setup can be used to test various network scenarios, learn networking concepts, and simulate real-world configurations. You can modify the configurations to suit your learning or testing requirements.</p>
